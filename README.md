BOT NOT FINISHED 

A discord biblebot for The New World Translation (https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e)


## Guide

To get a verse do:

`!english book chapter:verse`


* For now it can only pull out one verse at the time 
* Can't pull out books with a number infront of the name just yet (1 John etc)

It's being worked on, will update as more functionality is being added.
