BOT NOT FINISHED 

A discord biblebot for The New World Translation 2013 (https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e)

To get a verse do:

!english book chapter:verse

For now it can only pull out one verse at the time and can't pull out books with a number infront of the name (1 John etc)

It's being worked on, will update as more functionality is being added.
